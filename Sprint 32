- Check new docker environment works with the case study and xhci stack 
- Read up on the virtualisation (Josh's notes) 

Virtualisation
- A protection domain for each usb device that is plugged in (no communication between each device)
- Route each usb device to a virtualised machine, each linux thinks its is running on a physical machine 
- The usb device driver needs to know which traffic is coming from where and route it to each virtualised machine 
- Detect what the devices are early on (just get it working for a keyboard and a mouse)
- The usb driver can see both devices 

Goal
- Work out which traffic is coming from which device and seperate them out
- Initialise both devices and seperate them out

- Test the single picolibc on the maaxboard
- Remove the two instances of dma and test
- Test the new docker environment 
  - Can build in the new docker environement with the auts_microkit_stable package
  - Cannot build with sel4_modern_microkit due to mutliple references of mdelay

- Do i need to create the wrapper around linux?
- The devices will be initialised in the xhci controller 
- Build and run the xhci driver
- Work out where the initialisation of each device is happening and seperate out the streams 

Build xhci driver
- Need main of sel4-xhci

Notes for building xhci_driver
- Need to initialise the sddf submodule (git submodule update --init --recursive)
- Need to update manifest repository to use main branch of manifest repo

Initalisation of drivers notes
- Find where each driver is initialised and the name of each device
- Could make different protection domains for the mouse and keyboard, work out which is which from where the interrupt comes from 

Case_study error
- Look at m_delay name clash between microkit and the uboot driver library 
- Find the usb class api for the keyboard and the mouse and send over what has happened to the guest (the linux virtual machine)

19/06/2024
- Make a new branch for the usb routing example
- Split the xhci example into two protection domains

20/06/2024
Qna
- The xhci driver will show which devices are plugged into the maaxboard 
- Can you have generic protection domains which will route the devices 
- Should I catch the devices when they are probed, how to direct that device in a certain direction?
