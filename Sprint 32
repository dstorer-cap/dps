- Check new docker environment works with the case study and xhci stack 
- Read up on the virtualisation (Josh's notes) 

Virtualisation
- A protection domain for each usb device that is plugged in (no communication between each device)
- Route each usb device to a virtualised machine, each linux thinks its is running on a physical machine 
- The usb device driver needs to know which traffic is coming from where and route it to each virtualised machine 
- Detect what the devices are early on (just get it working for a keyboard and a mouse)
- The usb driver can see both devices 

Goal
- Work out which traffic is coming from which device and seperate them out
- Initialise both devices and seperate them out
