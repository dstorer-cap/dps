11/07/2024 - QnA
- Copied the image and file system over and built the guest example -> error with finding libresolv.so.2
- Rebuilt the guest using the instructions for the native version -> error with finding libresolv.so.2
- Built using version with no usbip in linux tools -> could load the modules but no usbip deamon 
- The device tree is different, would this effect it?

- When Bill removes the devices from the linux kernel it fails to unpack the ram filesystem
- The root filesystem might be too big - send instructions to Build Image and root file system
- Look at the native version and see where in the set up the traffic is being sent so can look at where to change to memory map -> add logging to native example
