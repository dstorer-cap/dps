- Look through the ip read me on the sddf to see how to test if it is working 
- Port the camkes components over to check if they will work with the current build

- Estimate how long it will take to port the camkes componenets over to the dev kit
- Work out the connections needed between the protection domains 
- Port the camkes components over

Notes on camkes code
- The security demo uses the picoserver component 
- These are the connections between the picosever and transmitter components 
        /* PicoServer <-> Transmitter connections */
        connection seL4PicoServerSignal eth_server_control(from transmitter.eth_control, to picoserver.pico_control);
        connection seL4PicoServer eth_server_recv(from transmitter.eth_recv, to picoserver.pico_recv);
        connection seL4PicoServer eth_server_send(from transmitter.eth_send, to picoserver.pico_send);
