- Look through the ip read me on the sddf to see how to test if it is working 
- Port the camkes components over to check if they will work with the current build

- Estimate how long it will take to port the camkes componenets over to the dev kit
- Work out the connections needed between the protection domains 
- Port the camkes components over

Notes on camkes code
- The security demo uses the picoserver component 
- These are the connections between the picosever and transmitter components 
        /* PicoServer <-> Transmitter connections */
        connection seL4PicoServerSignal eth_server_control(from transmitter.eth_control, to picoserver.pico_control);
        connection seL4PicoServer eth_server_recv(from transmitter.eth_recv, to picoserver.pico_recv);
        connection seL4PicoServer eth_server_send(from transmitter.eth_send, to picoserver.pico_send);
- The case study implements the echo.c file of the picoserver_uboot application in the transmitter.c file 
- transmit_pending_eth_buffer copies the data to the send buffer then instructs picoserver to transmit the data using the eth_send_send function

sddf lwip library description 
- The state struct stores the packets to be sent 
- When transmitting the head part of the struct is set to the buffer that is to be sent

xhci ethernet example
- data_packet memory region is used to store the packet to be sent 
- tcp write is how you send data from the ethernet, it is in the tcp_out.c file of the lwip library
