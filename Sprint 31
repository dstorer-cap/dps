- Test running the ethernet example without the uboot driver library initialised 
- Test sending protected procedures between pd's to see if I can send the result of the keyboard input
- Test setting up the ringbuffer in the crypto proctection domain

Plan for case study
- Send keypresses from keyreader straight to lwip using a ppcall to match how the driver is set up already
- Keypress is handled in function send_keypress in file utlization_socket.c 
- Need to work out how the kbd_buffer is sent out over the network (not through hardware interrupt)
- Set up the ringbuffers in keyreader to match the kbdlogger pd in the xhci ethernet example 
  - There might be a problem with setting up the ringbuffers as it allocates uses kmem

Problems
- Problem with ethernet driver might be down to differences in ethernet memory region / dma region
