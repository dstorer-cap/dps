- Test running the ethernet example without the uboot driver library initialised 
- Test sending protected procedures between pd's to see if I can send the result of the keyboard input
- Test setting up the ringbuffer in the crypto proctection domain

Plan for case study
- Send keypresses from keyreader straight to lwip using a ppcall to match how the driver is set up already
- Keypress is handled in function send_keypress in file utlization_socket.c 
- Need to work out how the kbd_buffer is sent out over the network (not through hardware interrupt)
- Set up the ringbuffers in keyreader to match the kbdlogger pd in the xhci ethernet example 
  - There might be a problem with setting up the ringbuffers as it allocates uses kmem

Problems
- Problem with ethernet driver might be down to differences in ethernet memory region / dma region
- Remove the ethernet paths and memory mapped region in the uboot driver library set up

- Can't send the keypresses at the same time as they are entered need to store in a buffer
- Set up two examples one where the keypresses are set up through the protected procedure call and on where the keypresses are written to are shared buffer

Things to test
- Use the stable version of microkit 
- Remove ethernet driver paths, mapping and set-up from example 
- Remove all unnessecary drivers from the example 

Notes
Each pd has its own virtual memory address space therefore the virtual memory addresses in each pd are specific to each pd

- Branch of the current branch to make a branch with no ethernet
- Ask Tom how to set up the shared buffer without the hacky way
