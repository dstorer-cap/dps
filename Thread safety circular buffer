- Producer(crypto) updates the head, consumer (transmitter) updates the tail
- Make sure data added by crypto is in the ram, do a cache flush
- Declare data as volatile 

1. Declare head and tail as volatile
2. Align the head and tail using __attribute_aligned to 64 bit alignments
3. Put safety guards around the producer (Crypto)
  - Cache invalidate before updating the buffer and head
  - Check that buffer is not full
  - Memory fence around the operations
  - Flush after updating the buffer and the head
4. Put safety guards around the consumer (transmitter)
  - Cache invalidate before reading the buffer
  - Check that buffer is not full
  - Memory fence around the operations
  - Cache flush after updating the tail
